# Mormir-Vig
Python code to grab all the files for Mormir Vig box and print them.

Based heavily on https://github.com/oboyone/mb_thermal_printer, but improved to be one file, actually get all the images, and repeatable.

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- Requests https://pypi.org/project/requests/
- Wand https://docs.wand-py.org
- Image Magick https://docs.wand-py.org/en/latest/guide/install.html

## Usage
Run getCards.py script from the folder where you want the sorted images to be placed.
By default will sort them into jpg/greyscale png and into cmc folders.

The MVig.py is faily custom to my setup, so usefullness will vary.
